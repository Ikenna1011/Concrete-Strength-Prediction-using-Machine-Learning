# Concrete-Strength-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and machine learning pipeline for predicting the compressive strength of concrete. The project is designed to demonstrate the end-to-end process of building a robust machine learning model, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment.

## Project Overview

Concrete is a widely used construction material, and its compressive strength is a critical property that determines its quality and usability. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its composition and other factors. The dataset used in this project includes eight input variables (e.g., cement, water, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, etc.) and one target variable, "strength."

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and outlier detection to ensure data quality.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhances the dataset by creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones for the model.
- **Model Building**: Implements and compares various regression algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting models.
- **Best Model Selection**: The CatBoostRegressor is identified as the best-performing model, achieving high accuracy in predicting concrete strength.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate model performance.
- **Deployment Ready**: The project is structured to facilitate easy deployment of the trained model for real-world applications.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a concrete manufacturing dataset that includes the following input variables:

1. Cement (kg/m³)
2. Blast Furnace Slag (kg/m³)
3. Fly Ash (kg/m³)
4. Water (kg/m³)
5. Superplasticizer (kg/m³)
6. Coarse Aggregate (kg/m³)
7. Fine Aggregate (kg/m³)
8. Age (days)

The target variable is:

- **Compressive Strength (MPa)**

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ikenna1011/Concrete-Strength-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Concrete-Strength-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to explore the analysis and train the models.

## Results

The CatBoostRegressor model outperformed other algorithms, achieving the following metrics:

- **R-squared**: 0.95
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 2.5 MPa
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 8.1 MPa²

These results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict the compressive strength of concrete.

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional features to improve model performance.
- Experiment with deep learning models for further accuracy improvements.
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
